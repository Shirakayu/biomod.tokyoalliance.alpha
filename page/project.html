        <h2>〇 Our Interesting</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                Our interest is a reaction such as LLPS and gelation by DNA. LLPS is one of the most interest topics among biologists since it was discovered in living cells,
                where it is possible to selectively aggregate various biological macromolecules, for example proteins, substrate, and nucleic acids, to promote specific chemical reactions(1).
                We, too, are interested in this currently hot topic, and set the goal of our project to design a device that can promote any reaction by controlling phase separation through DNA turning into hydrogel depending on specific input.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                Our project is to design a device that provides the benefits of DNA hydrogels in a inputｰspecific and localized by controlling gelation with reference to the existing DNA tools.
                Specifically, the design of a device that can form a gel by self-aggregating and increasing its concentration when it receives input DNA or RNA and can promote specific reactions based on its sequence.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="background">
        <h2>〇 Background</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                It is known that DNA can aggregate based on its complementarity to form hydrogels. For example, a method is known in which a linker DNA with sticky ends is used to connect Y-motif DNA to form a gel(2)(3). 
                Gelation in this way have several advantages of using DNA as a material. First, specific genes can be incorporated into the DNA that makes up the gel. 
                This allows cell-free synthesis of proteins in the hydrogel. Also, by incorporating aptamer sequences on it, specific substances or cells can be trapped into the gel. 
                Applying this technology is expected that only specific cells can be isolated, and drugs can be delivered while protected by the DNA gel.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                On the other hand, many intelligent tools have been developed using DNA as a material(4). Logic circuits such as and gate and Not gate, as well as molecular robots incorporating them as transducers, and computing networks constructed by combining several of them are known.
                This is made possible by the complementary joining of DNA and the associated formation of secondary and tertiary structures, or by the abundance of tools such as Nuclease and restriction enzymes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem">
        <h2>〇 Problem</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                As mentioned earlier, input-dependent DNA gelation has been reported using methods such as using linker DNA, however, the function of the gels so formed is greatly limited. These methods are limited to DNA structures with three or more sticky ends,
                for instance Y-motifs, and the density of the gel structure may be reduced because the structure itself becomes larger when significant sequences are incorporated. 
                Previous studies have introduced mechanisms to recognize and trap molecules in DNA gels, but they are limited to methods that utilize the properties of chemical substance that modified DNA with, for example, trapping streptavidin using biotin-modified DNA, 
                and are not able to provide functions depending on the DNA sequence that constitutes the gel yet (e.g., aptamers, coding gene).
                <br>
                &emsp;
                In other words, the design of DNA devices whose gelation is controlled by the input and whose function is determined by the sequence is the issue we are working on.    
            </p>


        </div>

        <div class="solution">
            <h2>〇 Our Solution</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;
                In designing our device, we turned to the rolling circle amplification (RCA)and its product, long-stranded DNA, which has a proven track record in both folding nanostructure and gelation. 
                Unlike PCR, which also uses polymerase, this reaction does not produce logarithmic amplification, but it does produce long-stranded DNA with repeated sequences that are complementary to the template circular DNA. 
                In a previous study on this RCA, it was reported that gelation was achieved by mixing two types of RCA product long-stranded DNA that have partially complementary sequences to each other, 
                and selective cell trapping was achieved by incorporating aptamer sequences simultaneously(5). In another paper, four types of staple DNA were successfully added to RCA products in appropriate conditions to form DNA Origami-like nanowire structures(6).
                <br>
                &emsp;
                By adding the domain for DNA strand displacement, we propose a device in which the staple DNA displace depended on input DNA and long-stranded DNA is released, i.e., changes from a DNA Origami-like structure to a DNA gel structure. 
                We believe that this will achieve a device in which gelation is controlled by the presence or absence of an input molecule, DNA, and which is also expected to be applied to the effective use of aptamer sequences in gels, as seen in previous studies.
                <br>
                &emsp;
                We named this device <strong>“DNA Mochi Device”</strong>.
